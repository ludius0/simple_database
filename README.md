# simple_database
I wrote program where you write your adress with your name and save it to the database. I used tkinter as simple GUI and SQLite3 as database with python.

I wanted try it, when I was learning tkinter from video.
Also this was my first attempt with SQLite3 as database, which I haven't tried before.
